This repo contains a meme I made for an assignment in the STATS 220: Data Technologies course at the University of Auckland (UoA) :) 

It currently contains: 
* An index.md Markdown outlining the meme's inspiration and the R code that was used for its creation 
* The raw image of the meme


Feel free to view the index file through GitHub Pages :)
